For anyone who wants to play online, but don't like being invaded by a random player, use version 1.0.8 of PvP Watchdog. That version has glitches that prevent summoning blues and being invaded by a random player. You can still use passwords and be summoned as a white/gold/red/purple phantom. And you can still use passwords to summon a white/gold/red/purple phantom. You can find version 1.0.8 here:

There is one type of invasion that PvP Watchdog 1.0.8 does not prevent: the fight with Halflight. If you're playing online and fight Halflight, there is a chance that another player would be summoned as the boss to fight you. This would happen regardless of whether you're in Embered form or not. Version 1.0.8 also prevents you from being summoned as a Spear of the Church while playing online.
